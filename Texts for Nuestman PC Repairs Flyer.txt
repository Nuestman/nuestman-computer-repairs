Noobie here.

#beginners

Hey, y’all.

I’m a noobie at web Development stuff. I have no formal education of it.

I’m a Registered Emergency Nurse in Ghana, West Africa.

I’ve always loved playing around with PCs since I got introduced to it as teenager.
Never really doing anything specific with it, not really knowing what exactly to do with it. So just learning general stuff by myself and jumping from one program to another.
Y’all know that feeling/state, I guess. Hehe.
I took a short virtual course/tutorial on graphic design, and I now feel like I like web Development/the concept of it more.
So I’m self-learning about that stuff now.
I just stumbled on this site/community by accident tonight when there appeared a suggested article in my feed, cos I’ve been for some time now searching html/css stuff more often.

I read a few of the articles, and I’m here now.

Hoping to learn more about Development, and hopefully build a career out of it, instead of just exploring and solving common computer problems for friends for free.

Any help asking this path is highly welcomed.
Thanks
